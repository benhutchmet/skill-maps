    "\n",
    "In the decadal predictions, we observe a pretty significant drop in skill post-2005 initiailisation. As the dataset is limited to around 50 years and we have only observed one 'forecast bust' like this, we don't know whether Doug was just lucky or whether something is actually going wrong in the models in the recent period.\n",
    "\n",
    "To explore this, we consider the seasonal hindcasts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CSF-20C (Coupled Seasonal Forecast):This is a hindcast performed with the model fully coupled to the Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean (NEMO) ocean model, initialised from CERA-20C reanalysis data.\n",
    "2. ASF-20C (Atmospheric Seasonal Forecasts): This is a hindcast performed with prescribed Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and sea-ice boundary conditions at the surface, initialised form ERA-20C reanalysis data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These both run from initialisation in 1901-2009, so give a longer time period.\n",
    "\n",
    "Strommen et al. (2023) propose that seasonal forecasts can be used to diagnose decadal forecast signals over a longer period. We plan to look at this in the context of 8 year running mean (years 2-9 of the decadal forecast) NAO predictability. In doing this, we want to explore the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Was the recent drop in NAO skill an outlier in the longer period (1901-2020)?\n",
    "* Have similar 'forecast bust' periods been observed before?\n",
    "* Are there similar conditions occuring during previous bust periods?\n",
    "    * i.e. divergence of model/obs SPNA SSTs"
